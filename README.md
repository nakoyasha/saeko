<p>This tool was mainly created to be used by me, and only me. So I probably <b>won't fix</b> most bugs with it, nor accept most pull requests.</p>

<p>Requires Visual Studio 2022/and above/whatever the hell VS2022 uses to build C# projects to build <i>(older versions and compilers might work too)</i></p>

<p>Also requires .NET Core 6.0 (probably!)</p>
